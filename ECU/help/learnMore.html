<p>A Tuner is only as good as the tools they are using. In today's
world the most important tools for tuning are no longer
found in your toolbox.
Just think, in the 1980's Top Fuel dragsters made 2500 hp using a 500
cubic inch ( 8.2 Liter) Aluminum Hemi headed
engine, as amazing as this might sound, today this same displacement
and very similar looking hemi headed engines are making over 8000 hp!
Why? It is all about optimizing all aspects of the engine to improving
efficiency. This demands the tools
to gather data so you can understand what is happening inside the
engine and identify opportunities to improve
efficiency. Together TunerStudio and MegaLogViewer bring you the power
to capture, view and analyze data as
your engine produces it, then act upon it. These easy to use
applications simplify making changes and even offer recommendations and
automatic correction
using data analytics at a level that is not offered by any other tuning
solutions at any price.</p>

<a name="veAnalyze"></a>
<p><a name="veAnalyze"><strong>VE Analyze Live!</strong> -
Yes it really does tune the car for you while you drive! Starting with
concepts of VE Analyze in MegaLogViewer and taking it to the next
level with dynamic offset record seeking.
Whether your just running with rough tables or have already put hours
into your tune, VE Analyze Live will dial in your fuel tables to a new
state.
Why does it work so well? By combining a vast tuning experience with
expertise in data analytics you can leverage technology to improve your
tune.
An expert tuner can look at a data log record and know what changes
that record is looking for, but one record can only tell so much.
At best a record only shows the inputs and results at that instant in
time with many other outside factors effecting the data.
One record nay tell you one thing, but another on the same cell will
say something else.
To produce the best results you need to look at each record, identify
and discard the ones that are junk due to other factors, then consider
ALL quality data.
That is where the human brain fails, it simply can not consider the
full picture, computers can. As you drive VE Analyze live will look at
all the data, filter what the junk and use weighted statistical
averages to calculate the optimal values for you Fuel tables.
</a></p>

<center>
<img src="images/VeAnalyzeSm.png" borders="0" alt="Click to view full size"></center>

VE Analyze Live offers:
<ul>

  <li><b>Automatic update to controller</b> - You can either have
TunerStudio produce a recommended table as you drive, or let it
acutally send the updates as you drive to continually improve you tune
while going down the road. </li>
  <li><b>Adjustable Standard Filter</b> - In addition to TunerStudio
filtering data with lack of credibility, you can adjust standard
parameters such as RPM, Coolant temp, load, MAP, MAF to match your
configuration or preference. </li>
  <li><b>Custom Filters</b> - One of the Standard Filters doesn't cut
it
for your setup? The custom filter lets you apply free form logical and
mathematical formulas to filter nearly any data you desire.</li>
  <li><b>Lambda Delay Table</b> - Compensates for delays to your Lambda
Sensor readings caused by not just the Lambda sensor itself, but more
importantly the time spent flowing through the exhaust pipes under
varying conditions. </li>
  <li><b>Heat Maps</b> - As you drive you can see how much data has
been
gathered for all sections of the table and how much the table values
have changed.</li>
  <li><b>Authority Limits</b> - Allow you to limit the amount of change
TunerStudio can make in a single session to prevent damage if something
goes wrong.</li>
  <li><b>Full Readouts</b> - Watch the major data elements as
TunerStudio
uses them with a gauge cluster and histogram to show just what your
engine is doing.</li>
