</strong><strong>GPS Support: </strong>You will find the integrated GPS
support very helpful in many ways and quickly will not want a data log
without it.
Once a GPS is setup in TunerStudio, all the common GPS
fields plus more like HP, Tq and Fuel consumption become fully integrated with your TunerStudio Project
therefore are available for display on gauges and will be captured in
your data logs. These fields include:<br>
<ul>
  <li>Latitude - GPS Latitude<br>
  </li>
  <li>Longitude - GPS Longitude<br>
  </li>
  <li>Heading - GPS Direction you are traveling<br>
  </li>
  <li>Accuracy - Reported GPS Accuracy based on visibility and quality of your GPS device</li>
  <li>Altitude - GPS Altitude in Meters</li>
  <li>GPS.PositionX - A relative position in meters along the East-West axis from the point in which you first aquired GPS lock.</li>
  <li>GPS.PositionY - A relative position in meters along the East-West axis from the point in which you first aquired GPS lock.</li>
  <li>GPS_Time - Standard GPS Time in ms.</li>
  <li>GPS_Update - Will show as 1 each time the GPS data was updating
for that log record, 0 if it is the same data as the last record.</li>
  <li>MPH - Speed in MPH</li>
  <li>KPH - Speed in KPH</li>
</ul>
For each of these Fields you will find a Gauge to display the values in
real-time. To change a Gauge to show the GPS field, right click on it
ans select:<br>
Application Gauges --&gt; The gauge of your choice.<br>
<br>

<strong>Supported GPS Devices</strong> - There are many GPS dongles you
can purchase for your Laptop that should be compatible. The typical
integration is a Virtual Com Port over USB or Bluetooth. However, you
will find that as with most things, the quality will vary between
devices, especially when used in a performance environment. The vast
majority of GPS dongles are only capable of 1 update per second. While
this is sufficent for the typical navigation system, it does not
provide the data rate you will want in a performance motor sports
situation or if you want a steady and reliable speedometer. It should
also be noted that some devices take a great deal longer to aquire a
satallite lock and operate with far fewer channels. <br>
For your best experience you will want a GPS capable of 10 Hz, that is
10 updates every second. That means that when you are capturing a data
log, you will have updated GPS data 10 times more often for much finer
grain positioning and speed logging. This also means the speed data can
be used for HP calculation in TunerStudio and MegaLogViewer with far
better results. <br>
Recommended GPS Device:<br>
<a href="https://www.efianalytics.com/products/BT-Q818XT.html?id=tshelp">QStarz BT-Q818XT</a>
- 10 Hz, 66 Channel, 115200 baud that works over USB or Bluetooth so it
can be used on your Android device as well. You can find GPS dongles
for half the price, but they only deliver 1/10th the data. <br>
<br>

<strong></strong><br>

<strong>GPS Setup:</strong><br>1st consult the documentation that came with your GPS. The documentation  will state the supported baud rate. <br>
2nd, connect the GPS dongle to your PC. If it is connected via USB, make sure you have installed any required drivers. <br>
If running Windows, a COM Port will be assigned to your device. It is
sometimes easiest to find out what port was assigned by going into
Windows Device Manager, <br>
expand the node for "Ports (COM &amp;LPT)", there are typically only a
couple devices there, one is most likely the port you use to connect to
your ECU, so in this case, try the other.<br>
- Bluetooth, If you are using bluetooth to connect, you will need to
pair with the GPS, it will then be assigned a COM Port as well.<br>
<br>
<strong>TunerStudio Setup:</strong>
Once you have your GPS device connected to your laptop, you will
connect to it by selecting the proper com port and baud rate in GPS
settings. <br>
In TunerStudio on the Main Menu, select:<br>
Communications --&gt; GPS Configurations<br>
<br>
In the GPS Configuration Dialog<br>
- Check "GPS Enabled"<br>
- Select the Connection Type "RS232 Serial Interface"<br>
- Select the COM Port you found in Device Manager<br>
- Set the baud found in your device documentation. For the QStars it is 115200, for most other GPS's it is 9600 baud.<br>
<br>
<p>
You will then need to restart TunerStudio to have all the GPS channels available. <br>
You can select any of the GPS gauges by right clicking on a gauge and selecting the gauge of choice under the GPS menu<br>
