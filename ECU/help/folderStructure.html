<strong><br>
</strong><strong>A note for everyone: </strong>It should be noted
that,
your Project folders and user preferences are located in a separate
location from application files. This insures Projects and prefernces
are never over written or modified by
an application upgrade. <br>

This remains true even if you do a full uninstall and
reinstall in windows, your preferences and projects will remain in tact.<br>

<br>

<strong>TunerStudio, Folder Structure</strong> - A brief over view is
for advanced users that may wish to modify any files related to a
project.<br>

This proveides an explaination of the folder structure for the
application and key files within both the Application installation
folder and the Project Folders<br>

TS keeps all files for a project in the Project directory tree, so the
project ini will never be replaced by an update. Actually since the
beginning of TS the projects have always remained backward compatible
with every upgrade.<br>

<strong></strong><br>

There are 2 key Folder structures, the project structure and the
installation
structure. Within these structures, the folders and files that might be
of interest are covered below; looking at the
installation 1st:<br>

<br>

<strong>[InstallationDir]:</strong><br>

By default: c:\Program Files\EFIAnalytics\TunerStudioMS\<br>

This directory and it's children are managed by the installer or update
and the intention is that there are files referenced here, but never
should be a need to edit or change anything within this structure. If
you do, you will run the risk of having it over written on an upgrade.<br>

<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Sub Folders of Installation</span>:<br>

Dash - These are the template dashboards that are offered in the Load
Gauge Cluster menu<br>

config\ecuDef - the ini files are stored here. Projects do not
reference these ini files, but on an ini mismatch, this is where TS
looks for it first and these are the ini's that will show up in the
Project Properties drop down. If you have a firmware not here, so you
browse to a new ini that TS does not have, it will be copied to the
Project structure and to this location if you have write permission to
this folder. Win 7 and Vista do not have permission unless you are
running as an administrator.<br>

<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">inc</span> - All table lookups and TS
specific ini fragments are here. The inc
files should not be edited here. If you need a new inc or to alter an
inc, it should be placed in the Project structure. The ini's should not
be edited here, if you want to alter the ini fragment, the fragment
should be included in the Project's ini or projects custom.ini. These
ini fragments are only loaded if the section was not found in the
project ini or custom.ini<br>

<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Projects</span> - these are only
reference Projects that are copied to the
TunerStudioProjects folder if there is no TunerStudioProjects folder.
These projects should not be opened directly and projects should not be
saved to this location as it is common to not have write access to this
location as on Windows 7 and Vista.<br>

<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">help</span> - Help files that are
displayed from the help menu and other areas in tha application are
located here.<br>

<br>

The other folders within the installation folder are primarily binary
files that TS owns and there should be no reason to modify, if modified
they may be over written on an update.<br>

<br>

<b>[ProjectStructure]:</b><br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">TunerStudioProjects folder</span> - by
default this is in your Documents folder
on any Windows, or your home folder on other OS's. If you create and
open a project in another location, TS will use that as your Projects
folder. No files within the Project Structure will be updated with an
update to TunerStudio.<br>

<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">TunerStudioLogFile.txt </span>- this
will always be located in you current
Projects folder, so if you change the Projects folder from
TunerStudioProjects, this file will move too.<br>

<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Sub folders</span> - Each Project will
have a folder with the Projects name. If
you rename a project folder, the Projects name will change and the
project will be updated accordingly. All files under this Project
folder are always referenced relatively, so you can copy the project to
another computer or make a copy of it to another project with a
different name.<br>

<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Project Folder</span> - By default
msq's will be saved to this top level
Projects folder. Also logs for tables written to the controller will be
written here. If "Automatically Load and Save Current Tune" is enabled
as it is by default, there will be a CurrentTune.msq file in the
Project Folder. All settings are saved to this file after ever page
burn or on project close. This file will be loaded on Project open.<br>

<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Subfolders Under the Project folder: </span><br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">DataLogs</span> - This is the default
location for data logs captured by TS or
converted from an SD log by TS.<br>

<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">dashboards</span> - all dashboards
used by the project are stored here,
whether it is main dashboards or secondary dashboards. It you use the
Load Dashboard dialog, it will reference the dashboards in the
[InstallFolder]\Dash\ folder, but once a dash is selected, it is copied
here. For the main dashboards the naming is dashboard.dash for the
front tab Main Dashboard, any additional dashboard you add will be
named by the name you gave that tab with a .dash extension. Secondary
Dashboards are saved by the dialog name.dash<br>

<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">inc</span> - this is where any inc
files that are specific to your project or
over-ride the one found in the [InstallDir]\inc\ folder. That makes
this the proper place to put files like the inc files produced by
EasyTherm if you are using an MS1 with non-GM sensors.<br>

<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">projectCfg</span> - this is where TS
stores files that are specific to this
project:<br>

mainController.ini - this will be a copy of the ini file you selected
on project creation and is the ini that will be used when you open the
project. This file is only written to by TS if you select a new ECU
Definition(ini) file, it read on project open. Any changes to this file
require a project reload to see. The fastest way to do a project reload
is CTRL+SHIFT+F10<br>

<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">project.properties</span> - Project
settings and user preferences
specific to this project are stored in this file. Things like Comm
Port, window
positions, Configuration Settings are store in this folder. It is saved
an over written every time you close the project.<br>

<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">custom.ini </span>- Optional file
manually created if you wish to add ini scripting to the
mainController.ini or over-ride something in the mainController.ini. By
placing those changes in this file they will not be over-written if you
change ECU definition files such as after a firmware upgrade.<br>

<br>

<br>

<b>Tune Files</b>
<br>
There are several file types for saving your Tune Settings, that is
settings you have on the controller for you setup. Here are the key
Tuner Settings files:<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">msq</span> - File that contains all tune
 settings from your MegaSquirt. This includes all tables, curves and 
tune dialog settings. Between this file and your project settings, you 
can fully restore your MegaSquirt. <br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">msqpart </span>-
 Only used in the TunerStudio 1.16 and higher, this file type is of the 
same format as an msq, but used for saving subset of tune settings. In 
TunerStudio there is now a concept of "dialog settings", where when you 
have any tune dialog open you can select to save or load just the 
settings in that dialog.  The msqpart extension is used to differentiate
 it from an msq which would contain all settings for that firmware.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">table </span>-
 .table format is used for saving a table to import elsewhere or another
 application such as MLV. It is an xml file that contains only the table
 X, Y and Z values. This is often used for backing up just your table, 
or exporting a table to import for a new firmware. The table values when
 store in a .table file are not tied to an specific format and if you 
import a .table file into a table of a different size, the values of all
 axis will automatically be interpolated.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">vex </span>-
 same as .table but deprecated do to limitations of the format. use of 
.table is preferred. vex is still available for interoperability with 
older apps.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">More on Save / Load dialog tune</span><br>
When you have any tune dialog open in TunerStudio 1.16 and higher, there is a File menu in the dialog with:<br>
File --&gt; Save dialog tune<br>
and<br>
File --&gt; Load dialog tune<br>
<br>
If
 you select "Save dialog tune", TunerStudio will save only any settings 
you see in the dialog, they will have an msqpart extension to 
differentiate it from and msq which would typically have all the 
settings in the controller. "Save dialog settings" will allow you to 
save specific parts of your tune settings to an msqpart file. So you can
 save just the ignition settings for example, then use them later as a 
starting point to set up a car with a similar ignition and firmware.<br>
<br>
Selecting
 "Load dialog settings" also only will alter the settings within that 
dialog. You can load either an msqpart or a full msq. If you load a full
 msq using "load dialog settings" TunerStudio will still only load the 
settings on that dialog, no other settings will be changed. So this 
allows you to load bits an pieces of various msq's.<br>
