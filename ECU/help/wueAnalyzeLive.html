<h3>Overview:</h3>

Tuning of Warmup carries some challenges that
are somewhat different from the tuning your fuel tables. Where as when
tuning your fuel tables you can collect data, make changes and observer
the impact of those changes then readjust if needed,&nbsp; with warmu
up enrichment you only get one try
a day. Once it is warmed up, you probably
don't get to start off with a completely cold engine again until
tomorrow, even then how cold depends on your weather. This is what
makes Warm up Enrichment (WUE) Tuning an ideal candidate for auto tune.
Your laptop can capture all the data needed to dial in your WUE in as
little as 1 to 2 passes.<br>

<br>

You may first want to familiarize yourself with the available settings
in case you do need them, the default setting should work fine in the
majority of cases.<br>

Then go to the <a href="#usingWUEAnalyze">Using WUE Analyze</a>
section for the simple steps to have
WUE Analyze correct your WUE.<br>

<ul>

  <li><b>Update Controller checkbox</b> -
(Only Available on some firmwares such as MegaSquirt 3.) When checked,
WUE Analyze will update the controller periodically
with the recommended values. It will act as if you are pressing the
Apply button. <br>
  </li>
  <li><b>Apply Button</b> - When
clicked, the
recommended values will be written to the controller. When using
firmwares that do not support Update Controller, Burn must then also be
clicked for the new values to take effect. For WUE Analyze, this is
typically only used when you have completed the warm up cycle or if you
want to apply the recommended values after your ECU has been power
cycled.<br>
  </li>
  <li><b>Burn / Save on ECU Button</b> - This signals the
Controller to persist the values in RAM to Flash so they are stored for
use after the controller is power cycled. When values are written to
RAM, but not flash, however once the
controller is power cycled they are lost and the values will be loaded
from Flash. So this button should be clicked when you are finshed and
what to keep you values.</li>
  <li><b>Start / Stop Auto Tune Button</b> -
Activates and deactivates WUE Analyze.</li>
</ul>

This curve graph has 2 lines to display the
current controller warm up enrichment settings and the generated
recommended settings:
<ul>

  <li><b>Yellow Line</b> - Represents what
is currently in the controller. This is the WUE settings the engine is
currently running on.</li>
  <li><b>Blue line</b> - Represents the
recommended WUE curve that will be applied upon completion.</li>
</ul>

You will at some point also see dashed
lines. They show the original position of these curves when the WUE
session 1st began.<br>

show data being collected and how much data is being filtered. Take
note of the Active Filter, when a data filter is on, it will display
what one in yellow to help bring it attension. While there is a filter
lit in yellow, WUE analyzer is skipping the data that is currently

<ul style="text-align: left;">
  <li><b>AFR Temperature Adjustment to Lambda</b>
- For most less radical engines targeting your standard stoich AFR is
desireable. However, for various reasons you may want the engine to run
more or less rich during warmup. Adjusting this curve allows you to
raise or lower the target AFR during warmup. By Adjusting the curve
down, the target AFR for that temperature will be lowered. For example
if your target AFR at 32 degrees is 14.7:1 under normal condition and
this table is set at -0.5, WUE Analyze will use 14.2:1 as the target
AFR.<br>
  </li>
  <li><b>High Throttle Filter</b>
- Sets a throttle threshold to filter data over. By default set to 15,
so any throttle position over 15% will be filtered during a WUE Analyze
Live session.</li>
  <li><strong>Custom
Filter </strong>- Allows you to set any valid expression that will
filter additional input data.</li>
  <li>AFR Targets - Opens or select what AFR target Table to use. By
Default your normal running AFR table is used, but you can set this to
a different one or custom TunerStudio table.<br>

WUE Analyze Live:</strong></a><br>
</div>
<div style="text-align: left;">Operation
of WUE Analyze should begin with a cold engine. If it is not that cold
this time of year, not to worry, you can use it on the warmup from what
ever temperature it is and perhaps come back to it when the weather
turns cooler. <br>
<br>
To begin using WUE Analyze Live:<br>
</div>
<ol style="text-align: left;">
  <li>Power on your ECU</li>
  <li>Connect TunerStudio, and go to the
WUE Analyze Screen by clicking on the "Tune Analyze Live - Tune For
You" tab. There will be a sub tab for WarmupEnrichment1, select that.</li>
  <li>On the Warm up Enrichment Analyze tab,
go ahead and click "Start
Auto Tune". There will be steady active filters until the engine is
started, so it will not begin processing the data.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Now proceed to start your engine. <br>
  </li>
  <li>Important! - Once your engine is running, try to maintain a
steady RPM through the warmup process. Normally idle is good, but if
you have an engine that does not yet want to idle while cold, hold the
engine at a steady RPM from 1500 to 2500 RPM.</li>
  <li>Wait and watch. See what changes are recommended until it gets up
to running temperature.</li>
  <li>Once the engine is warmed up, Do not turn off the engine. Review
the recommendation to insure it appears correct. Then Click "Stop
Autotune", then <span style="font-weight: bold;">Burn</span>.<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
    </span></li>
  <li>After Burn is clicked, the new Recommended WUE is saved to your
ECU and you can turn off the engine. Try out your new WUE settings on
the next warmup<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></li>
