        It is recommended that you update yout project ECU Definition (INI file)
        and restore the Tune Settings from your project by clicking the button below.<br><br>
        If there have been changes in what settings are available in the new firmware compared to
        your previous firmware, you may receive warning messages.
        In most cases these warnings are not important, however it is advisable
        to review any related settings to insure the settings are correct for your configuration.<br><br>
