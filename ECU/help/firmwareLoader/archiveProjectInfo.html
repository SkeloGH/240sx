        Before upgrading your firmware, you may want to save a backup of your current TunerStudio project to a file.
        This will insure you can restore a copy of your TunerStudio project to the existing state in the event you
        roll back to the current firmware. <br><br>
        All dashboards, project settings, Tune Files, current ECU Definition (ini) file and data log files (optional) are saved to the project backup.<br><br>
        <h3>Important!!!!</h3>
        The firmware currently on your ECU will not be saved. In the event you want to restore
        the current firmware you will need to have and load that firmware, then load the tune settings in in this backup.
