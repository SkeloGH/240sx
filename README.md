# 240sx
My Nissan 240sx tune project

## Overview
I got a 1989 KA24e (SOHC) 240sx which got a DOHC head swap plus a turbo, took it to several mechanics, none of them were ale to make him run properly, so I'm going to try it myself.

Here you will find documentation, logs and notes of my jorney making the car run.
